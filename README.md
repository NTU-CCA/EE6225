# EE6225 - Process Control

### Learning Objective:

This course is intended to provide a review of modern process control engineering. The purpose of the course is to serve as an introduction to process dynamics, modeling and control. The objectives include: (a) equipping students with basic understanding of issues related to basic control algorithms, advanced control strategies, multivariable control, plant parameter estimation, and process modelling and simulation; (b) enhancing students’ skills and techniques
for tackling practical process control system design problems through case studies.

### Content:

Basic Control Algorithms. Model Predictive Control. Multivariable Control. Plant Parameter Estimation. Case Studies in Process Control.

### Learning Outcome:

On completion of this course, students should be confident to handle tasks on modelling, analysis, design and implementation of control systems for the process industry.
